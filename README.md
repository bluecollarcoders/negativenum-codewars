Completed over 100 katas 
## How its made
With javascript I push code everyday. Sometimes 3x a day.

## Optimizations
I usually refactor to increase readiblity. I then post on Linkedin to document my journey.

## Lesson Learned
Being diligent and consistent. It's better to get the answer request the solution if you don't figure it out within 25 minutes. I think that's a better model when learning.
